# C-C-headerfiles
This is the 1.0 release of new header files.
This is done to reduce the code and to add more automation to the language.
This is under development and new features will be rolled out and released in the next versions. 
Note: There are some bugs in the fcword() function which have been not fixed in this release. Work is under way to fix this bug. Once the bug is fixed a new release will be uploaded.
